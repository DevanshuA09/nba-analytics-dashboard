## Pipeline Summary

The NBA Analytics Pipeline has been successfully completed with the following components:

### 1. Data Acquisition
- Fetched NBA data for multiple seasons using nba_api
- Collected team game logs, player game logs, and team statistics
- Implemented rate limiting and error handling

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Created comprehensive feature sets with rolling averages
- Added advanced metrics (ORtg, DRtg, Pace, TS%, eFG%, etc.)
- Implemented contextual features (home/away, rest days, momentum)

### 3. Model Training

#### Team Win Probability Model
- **Best Model**: {max(team_results.keys(), key=lambda x: team_results[x]['auc'])}
- **AUC**: {max(team_results[x]['auc'] for x in team_results):.4f}
- **Accuracy**: {max(team_results[x]['accuracy'] for x in team_results):.4f}

#### Player Points Forecast Model
- **Best Model**: {min(player_results.keys(), key=lambda x: player_results[x]['rmse'])}
- **RMSE**: {min(player_results[x]['rmse'] for x in player_results):.4f}
- **RÂ²**: {max(player_results[x]['r2'] for x in player_results):.4f}

### 4. Model Validation
- Both models successfully loaded and tested
- Inference functions working correctly
- Ready for production deployment

### 5. Files Generated
- `models/team_win_final.pkl` - Trained team win model
- `models/player_pts_final.pkl` - Trained player points model
- `evaluation_team.md` - Team model evaluation report
- `evaluation_player.md` - Player model evaluation report
- `data/features/` - Processed feature datasets
- `pipeline.log` - Complete pipeline log

## Next Steps
1. Deploy models to production API
2. Set up real-time data updates
3. Monitor model performance
4. Retrain models periodically with new data
